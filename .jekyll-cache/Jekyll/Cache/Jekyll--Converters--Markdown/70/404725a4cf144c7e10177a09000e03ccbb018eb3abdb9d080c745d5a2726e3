I"+<p>Our <a href="https://www.omics.kitchen/">lab</a> has been working with a number of collaborators on a study of lateral flow assays for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Weâ€™ve designed and implemented an interactive <a href="https://covid.omics.kitchen/">app</a> to complement the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.02.20248998v1">study</a>. Interested parties getting an antibody test are advised to speak with their healthcare provider about interpreting their results with that app, which uses local COVID19 prevelance data from <a href="https://usafacts.org/visualizations/coronavirus-covid-19-spread-map/">usafacts.org</a> (also used by the CDC) and measurments from the study to estimate the probability they do or do not have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies given their result.</p>
