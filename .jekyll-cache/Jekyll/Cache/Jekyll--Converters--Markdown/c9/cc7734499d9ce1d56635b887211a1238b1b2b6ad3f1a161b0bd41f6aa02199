I"∆<p>Salutations!<br />
A friend of mine recently asked me for some pointers on Python import statements, and I thought I would share what I came up with. The import command allows us to use code from other libraries, directories, source files, etc. It‚Äôs a fundamental tools that‚Äôs been around since way before Python (think ‚Äú#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;‚Äù, and further). The structure is easier to demonstrate if we break from our go-to Jupyter format, so have a look at the project <a href="https://github.com/sweeney-th/importsExample">here</a>. Have a look at the code in utils.py, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OtherUtils/utils\_one\_dir_down.py</code>, and then read the mains!</p>
