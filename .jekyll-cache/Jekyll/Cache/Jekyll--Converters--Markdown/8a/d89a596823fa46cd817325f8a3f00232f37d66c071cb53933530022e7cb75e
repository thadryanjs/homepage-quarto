I"}<p>Last year, I read an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/">article</a> on <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/">FiveThirtyEight</a> about gun deaths in the US. Intrigued, and looking for some practice, I started poking around in the <a href="https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/guns-data">dataset</a> myself. I noticed what seemed to an odd drop in February of each year, and it got me curious about seasonality in the dataset. I’ve returned to it to give it a proper look. If you’re curious, you can see the project <a href="http://pythoninthewyld.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Main.nb_.html">here</a>.</p>
