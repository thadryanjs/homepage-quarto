I"Ú<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-systemic-police-racism-11591119883">Op-ed</a> Heather Mac Donald presents the following quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚Äúno significant evidence of antiblack disparity in the likelihood of being fatally shot by police‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This quote does not appear in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877https://www.pnas.org/content/116/32/15877">Johnson et al</a>, the study she cites.</p>

<p>The quote comes from a pre-print (before peer review) reply to a letter criticizing the methodology.</p>

<p>Reading the <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/dmhpu/">pre-print</a> and the <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/3/1264">published</a> version reveals the quote appears in the pre-print (uploaded August 16, 2019) but not in the published literature (published, January, 21, 2020).</p>
