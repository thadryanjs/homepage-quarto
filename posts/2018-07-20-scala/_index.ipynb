    "Scala is a JVM language that seeks to marry functional and object-oriented programming styles. It was was Designed by Martin Odersky and first appeared in 2004. While I think many projects that aspire to \"best of both worlds\" status end up ugly and chimeric, my explorations with Scala have revealed a really thoughtful and lovely creation that elegantly merges different paradigms. While it isn't one of the top-tier languages for for production code job hunting (think Java, C++, Python, JavaScript, etc), it made the GitHub top 15 list for most common languages recently. I suspect much of this is because it's becoming popular as a language for data science as a happy medium language between the breezy-to-write-but-relatively-slow Python and the incumbent production veteran Java that is faster but comes with a notoriously verbose syntax (still very much worth learning though!). Scala aims to be approachable and quick to develop as well as fast (some tests show it performing at Java speed or better), thus avoiding the need to \"productionize\" slower, exploratory code if a project grows (The name \"Scala\" is a shortening of the \"Scalable Language\", after all). Nobody is going to be putting Java out of business any time soon (just ask the flashier start-up favorite Ruby, but Scala joins Python, Java, and R as a helpful tool for data and general purpose coding. After spending a good amount of time with the Scala home page, \"Scala for the Impatient\"by Cay S. Horstmann, and Bruce Eckel's classic \"Thinking in Java\", I opted to create an overview for my own edification and for some people I know who are newcomers to the language. Happy Hacking."
